The aim of the study is to create a system for automatic analysis of magnetic resonance images, the aim of which is to investigate the possibility of determining the methylation status of the MGMT promoter and qualifying patients to the "methylated" and "unmethylated" classes on the basis of imaging features. It was proposed to extract features from full resonance scans and then use machine learning algorithms to classify such data. The study uses data from this year's RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2021 competition. Four magnetic resonance imaging sequences are available for each patient (T1w, T1wCE, T2w, T2-FLAIR). All scans are available in DICOM (.dcm) format, so single 3D NIFTI image files (.nii) were first created from them. The experimental research included a five-fold cross-validation, which allowed to verify the performance quality of the developed classification models using the extracted radiomic features.
